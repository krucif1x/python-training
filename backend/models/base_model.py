        ----------

        Performing inference of the model to detect landmarks (e.g., face, hand, pose) based on the provided model.

        This method processes the input image and detects relevant landmarks using a pre-trained model.
        The specific type of landmarks (e.g., face, hand, pose) detected depends on the model being used (e.g., YOLO, ResNet, Mediapipe, etc.)

        Parameters
        ----------
        image : cv2.Mat
            The image that will be inputted to the model in form of cv2 array format
        preprocessed : bool
            Flag to tell the function does the image need to be preprocess or not, if it False then the image will be inputted to the inference stage first
            before going to do prediction/inference stage, if it's True is otherwise

        Return
        ----------
        The detected landmarks (could be face, hand, pose landmarks, etc.). It was up to the models that you are using (Yolo, Resnet, etc)
